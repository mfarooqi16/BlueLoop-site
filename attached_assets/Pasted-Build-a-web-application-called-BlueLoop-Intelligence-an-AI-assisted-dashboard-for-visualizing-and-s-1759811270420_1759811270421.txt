Build a web application called BlueLoop Intelligence, an AI-assisted dashboard for visualizing and simulating ocean-based carbon sequestration potential in coastal ecosystems like kelp forests, seagrass meadows, and mangroves.

The app should include the following pages and features:

Home Page
Clean, ocean-inspired design (teal/blue color palette, minimalist style).

Brief description: “BlueLoop Intelligence models and visualizes oceanic carbon capture potential using satellite data and AI.”

Buttons for “Open Dashboard” and “Learn More.”

Dashboard Page
An interactive map (Google Maps or Mapbox plugin) showing coastal zones.

A data panel with charts for:

Sea Surface Temperature (SST)

Chlorophyll-a concentration

Turbidity (water clarity)

A Carbon Potential Score gauge or bar that updates when users select a region.

Ability to filter by date range and variable type.

Option to show time-series graphs.

AI Simulation Page
Two sliders or input boxes:

“Change in Sea Surface Temperature (°C)”

“Change in Nutrient Levels (%)”

When adjusted, recalculate and display the new Carbon Potential Score dynamically.

Add placeholder logic for now (e.g., “increase temperature by 1°C decreases score by 5%”).

Ensure this page can later connect to an external API endpoint for real machine learning predictions.

Data Upload Page
Users can upload CSV files (e.g., SST, chlorophyll, or local survey data).

Uploaded data should appear in a simple table and update the dashboard charts.

Reports Page
Generate a summary report with key metrics and charts.

Allow users to download as PDF or share via link.

User Authentication
Add sign-up, login, and user profile pages.

Users can save simulation results and uploaded datasets.

Admin / Settings Page (optional)
Admin can update site content, upload reference datasets, or manage users.

General Design Requirements:

Use a blue/teal minimalist theme with subtle ocean background.

Make the layout responsive (mobile & desktop friendly).

Include sample dummy data for California coastal regions (temperature, chlorophyll, turbidity).

Each chart or graph should have labels and tooltips for clarity.

Future Integration Placeholder:

Add a configurable field in the settings to specify an external REST API endpoint that returns predicted carbon potential (JSON).

The app should be able to fetch and display predictions from that API later.

App Summary Text (for landing page footer): “BlueLoop Intelligence combines open ocean data and AI modeling to help researchers and policymakers understand and forecast blue carbon potential in coastal ecosystems.”

Generate the full app with navigation, consistent styling, and dummy data included.
