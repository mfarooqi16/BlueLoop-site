You are building BlueLoop Intelligence, an AI-assisted ocean carbon sequestration dashboard that combines environmental data visualization, user simulations, and scientific carbon accounting.
The goal is to allow users to explore, simulate, and report carbon sequestration potential in coastal ecosystems using real satellite data and machine learning.

🌍 Core Features

Home Page: Ocean-inspired interface with project intro, “Explore Dashboard” button, and educational section on blue carbon.

Interactive Dashboard:

Mapbox map of coastal California.

Clickable regions displaying Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Chlorophyll-a, and Turbidity charts.

Dynamic Carbon Potential Score gauge that updates based on map selections.

AI Simulation Page:

Sliders for temperature, turbidity, and nutrient levels.

“Calculate Potential” button → calls backend ML API.

Returns predicted carbon sequestration potential (tons C/km²/yr) and CO₂e.

Display a confidence or uncertainty bar.

Reports Page:

Summary charts + map snapshot + user simulation results.

Button to export as PDF (“Generate Report”).

Data Upload Page:

Upload custom CSV (SST, Chl-a, etc.) → preview and visualize.

Integrates uploaded data into charts or allows recalculation with AI model.

User Authentication:

Sign-up/login via Supabase Auth (preferred) or Replit Auth fallback.

Each user can save multiple simulations and name them.

Saved simulations re-load on login.

Database Layer:

Store user simulations, uploaded datasets, and generated reports in Supabase.

Each record includes: user_id, timestamp, region, inputs, predicted_carbon, co2eq.

PDF Generation:

Export simulation report as PDF including charts and map region.

Include carbon potential, CO₂e, and uncertainties.

⚙️ Backend Integration

Connect to FastAPI-based backend (to be deployed on Render or Cloud Run):

Endpoint: /predict?SST=<>&Chlorophyll=<>&Turbidity=<>

Returns JSON:

{
  "CarbonPotential": 24.5,
  "CO2eq": 90.0,
  "Uncertainty": 0.12
}


Display the results dynamically in the AI Simulation Page and Dashboard gauge.

Handle errors gracefully (e.g., if backend is offline).

🧠 Carbon Accounting Logic

1 ton Carbon = 3.67 tons CO₂e.

Include permanence slider (default 0.8 = 80% stored).

Compute Adjusted_CO2eq = CO2eq * Permanence.

Display both raw and adjusted CO₂e in the dashboard.

🗺️ Visualization Libraries

Use Mapbox GL JS or Leaflet for maps.

Use Recharts or Plotly for charts (temperature, chlorophyll, turbidity).

Use a gauge component (e.g., react-circular-progressbar) for the Carbon Potential Score.

Use TailwindCSS for styling (ocean color palette: teal, navy, coral accents).

📦 Architecture Summary
Frontend: React (Vite + Tailwind)
Auth: Supabase Auth
DB: Supabase Postgres (Simulations, Uploads)
API: FastAPI backend (hosted on Render)
Visualization: Mapbox + Recharts
File Storage: Supabase Storage
PDF Reports: react-pdf or jsPDF
Hosting: Vercel or Replit (frontend)

🧩 Extra Features

“Compare Scenarios” view → side-by-side charting of two saved simulations.

“Global Explorer” (optional) → global heatmap showing high carbon potential zones.

Tooltip explanations (educational layer for each metric).

AI Assistant widget (“Explain My Score”) → optional GPT-based helper to interpret results.

🧑‍💻 Development Instructions

Scaffold project using React + Vite + Tailwind.

Add routes: /, /dashboard, /simulation, /upload, /reports.

Integrate Supabase for Auth, Database, and Storage.

Add a config.js for API endpoints and keys.

Connect /predict API call in Simulation and Dashboard.

Implement report generation using react-pdf.

Test the app end-to-end with mock data.

✅ Goal

Deliver a fully functional MVP of BlueLoop Intelligence that:

Visualizes satellite data for ocean carbon monitoring.

Simulates sequestration potential using an ML backend.

Allows user-authenticated uploads, saved simulations, and PDF report exports.

Provides scientific transparency and educational context.
